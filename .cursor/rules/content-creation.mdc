UI and Content Creation Guidelines

UI Standards

The UI must follow the fonts and design described in the engineering-standards.mdc file.

New Content Creation

Follow the existing practices inside the components folders in app/(frontend).

File Structure for Components

component.tsx → UI file

config.ts → Payload CMS configuration file that defines the UI block creation

Workflow

Start with the given code for types and UI.

Create a working Payload CMS configuration (config.ts).

Run:

pnpm payload generate:types


This generates new TypeScript types for Payload CMS.

Update your code to use the newly generated types instead of the old ones.

Add the content to RenderBlocks.tsx, following existing examples.

Run:

pnpm run lint


to fix any TypeScript errors (warnings can be ignored).
